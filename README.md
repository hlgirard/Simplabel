# Simplabel
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/simplabel.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/simplabel)
![Travis CI status](https://travis-ci.com/hlgirard/Simplabel.svg?branch=master)

Graphical tool to manually label images in distinct categories to build training datasets.
Simply pass a list of categories, a directory containing images and start labelling.
Supports multiple users, reconciliation and keyboard bindings to label even faster!

## Installation

### Install with pip

Simplabel is on PyPI so it can be installed with pip

```
pip install simplabel
```

### Install from source

Clone the repository to your computer

```
git clone https://github.com/hlgirard/Simplabel.git
```

and install with pip 

```
cd Simplabel
pip install .
```

## Usage

### Quick start

Pass the labels and image directory on the command line to start labelling. Use the on-screen buttons to select a label for the current image and advance to the next one. Number keys correspond to labels and can be used instead.

```
simplabel --labels dog cat bird --directory path/to/image/directory
```

Note that simplabel can now be called without any arguments as follows: `simplabel`.
The user will be prompted to select an image directory and labels can be added with the + button at the bottom of the screen.

After the first use, labels are stored in `labels.pkl` and the `--labels` argument is ignored.

### Command line arguments

- `-d, --directory <PATH/TO/DIRECTORY>` sets the directory to search for images and save labels to. Defaults to the current working directory.
- `-l, --labels <label1 label2 label3 ...>` sets the categories for the labelling task. Only passed on the first use in a given directory.
- `-u, --user <USERNAME>` sets the username. Defaults to the OS login name if none is passed.
- `-r, --redundant` does not display other labelers selections for independent labelling. Reconciliation and Make Master are unavailable in this mode.
- `-v, --verbose` increases the verbosity level.
- `--remove-label` tries to safely remove a label from the list saved in `labels.pkl`.
- `--reset-lock` overrides the lock preventing the same username from being used multiple times simultaneously.
- `--delete-all` removes all files created by simplabel in the directory

### Multiuser

The app relies on the filesystem to save each user's selection and display other user's selections. It works best if the working directory is on a shared drive or in a synced folder (Dropbox, Onedrive...). The Reconcile workflow allows any user to see and resolve conflicts. The Make Master option can be used to create and save a master dictionary - `labeled_master.pkl` - containing all labeled images (after reconciliation).

### Import saved labels

The app saves a `labeled_<username>.pkl` file that contains a pickeled dictionary {image_name: label}. To import the dictionary, use the following sample code:

```python
import pickle

with open("labeled_user1.pkl","rb") as f:
    label_dict = pickle.load(f)
```

## Advanced usage

### Utilities

Once you are done labelling, use the flow_to_directory tool to copy images to distinct directories by label

```
flow_to_directory --rawDirectory data/raw --outDirectory data/labeled
```

### Python object

The Tkinter app can also be started from a python environment

```python
from simplabel import ImageClassifier
import tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk() 
directory = "data/raw"
categories = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
MyApp = ImageClassifier(root, directory, categories)
tk.mainloop()
```
